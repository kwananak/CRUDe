# CRUDe
Small CRUD linked to mySQL database with html interface

There's never too much oil! Pump, refine and spill (and look at) all the oil! Use localhost:8080/ and get to the html page. Use the html interface to send requests to a very lite CRUD. That CRUD is linked to a mySQL databse. Some flair is added with custom made Visuals. And some artistic liberties were taken with the whole oil process.

made using:
mysql
eclipse
github
lombok
maven
springboot
thymeleaf
"hibernate"
"tomcat"
